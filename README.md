**Project Title: React E-Commerce Website utilizing Context API and useContext Hook**

---

## Overview

Welcome to our React E-Commerce Website project! This repository contains the codebase for an innovative online shopping platform built using React. Leveraging the powerful Context API and useContext Hook, we've developed a seamless shopping experience for users.

## Features

- **Context API Integration**: We've employed React's Context API to manage global state efficiently throughout the application, ensuring a consistent data flow without prop drilling.
  
- **useContext Hook**: By utilizing the useContext Hook, we've simplified the process of consuming context within functional components, enhancing readability and maintainability of the codebase.
  
- **Dynamic Product Listings**: Users can browse through a dynamically generated list of products, with real-time updates reflecting changes in inventory and pricing.

- **Responsive Design**: Our website is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication ensures a personalized shopping experience, with features such as user-specific carts and order history.
